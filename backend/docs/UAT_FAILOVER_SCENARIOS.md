5. Monitor sync queue buildup
6. Restore network connectivity
7. Verify automatic sync recovery

**Expected Results:**
- âœ… Isolated devices continue local operations
- âœ… Sync queue builds up during partition
- âœ… Automatic recovery when network restored
- âœ… All queued operations sync successfully

**Success Criteria:**
- Local operations continue during partition
- Queue recovery time < 60 seconds
- No data loss during partition
- All operations sync after recovery

### Scenario 3.2: Complete Network Partition
**Objective:** Test recovery from complete network isolation

**Test Steps:**
1. Start all devices with full connectivity
2. Establish sync and create data
3. Simulate complete network partition
4. Perform operations on all isolated devices
5. Monitor sync queues on all devices
6. Restore network connectivity
7. Verify master election and sync recovery

**Expected Results:**
- âœ… All devices operate independently during partition
- âœ… Sync queues build up on all devices
- âœ… Master election occurs when network restored
