2. Are error messages easy to understand? (Yes/No/Partially)
3. Does the system respond quickly during transactions? (Yes/No/Sometimes)
4. What would make the system easier to use?

### 2. Scenario-Based Feedback

#### Validation Error Scenarios
**Test Cases:**
1. **Invalid Device ID**: Try registering with special characters
2. **Invalid Role**: Attempt to use unsupported role values
3. **Invalid Priority**: Test priority values outside 0-100 range
4. **Missing Fields**: Submit incomplete registration data
5. **Dangerous Characters**: Test SQL injection attempts

**Feedback Questions:**
- Was the error message clear and helpful?
- Did the system prevent the invalid action?
- Was recovery from the error easy?
- Would you like different error handling?

#### Sync Operation Scenarios
**Test Cases:**
1. **Network Disconnection**: Test behavior during network loss
2. **Concurrent Updates**: Multiple users editing same data
3. **Master Failover**: Test automatic master election
4. **Data Conflicts**: Test conflict resolution process
5. **Large Data Sets**: Test performance with many records

**Feedback Questions:**
- Was the sync process transparent?
- Did you understand what was happening?
- Was data consistency maintained?
- How did the system handle conflicts?

### 3. Performance Feedback

#### Response Time Metrics
- **Device Registration**: Time from request to confirmation
- **Data Sync**: Time from change to all devices updated
- **Error Handling**: Time from error to user notification
- **Master Election**: Time from trigger to completion

#### Reliability Metrics
- **Uptime**: System availability during testing
- **Error Rate**: Percentage of failed operations
- **Recovery Time**: Time to recover from errors
- **Data Integrity**: Consistency across devices
